# ASE

Programs: ase_normalisation_sim.pl and ase_normalisation_compare.pl

These two programs can be used to normalise mapped PE RNA sequencing files and produce an output file giving a P-value for the liklihood that the site is deviating from an allele ratio of 50:50.

Details for running the programs can be obtained through the --help options.
